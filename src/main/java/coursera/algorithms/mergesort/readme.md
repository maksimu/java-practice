Notes:

Basic plan:
    - divide array into two halves
    - RECURSIVELY sort each half
    - MERGE two halves

- Uses divide & conquer method - that is to divide a problem into two halves and solve it, do it recursively.
- Requires the copy of the array to be sorted. If one is too big then this sort will take twice the amount of memory
